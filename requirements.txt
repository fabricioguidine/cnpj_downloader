# 📦 CNPJ Downloader — Receita Federal CNPJ Open Data Scraper

This Python script automates the download of **all public CNPJ datasets** available on the Receita Federal website. It crawls through each dated directory and downloads **every available file** (.zip, .txt, etc.), saving them in a structured local folder.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Recursively crawls every monthly folder
- ✅ Downloads all files inside each folder
- ✅ Skips already downloaded files
- ✅ Preserves original folder structure
- ✅ Uses only `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` (no browser automation needed)

## ⚠️ Important Limitation

> 💡 If the script is **interrupted during a file download** (e.g., closed, killed, or lost connection), that **partial file will still be skipped** the next time you run it.

This is because the script checks if the file **exists** before downloading it — it doesn’t verify if the file is **complete or corrupted**.

To avoid this:
- Delete any incomplete files manually before restarting the script
- Or enhance the script to verify file size or checksum after download (not included by default)

## 💡 Customization Tips

Want to enhance the script?

- ✅ **Download only `.zip`**: add a filter in the loop
- ✅ **Unzip after download**: integrate with `zipfile` or `shutil`
- ✅ **Add logging or CSV reports**: use Python `logging` or `csv` modules
- ✅ **Verify file integrity**: check file size or hash to avoid partial downloads
